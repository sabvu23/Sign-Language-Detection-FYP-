Sign Language Recognition (SLR) deals with recognizing hand gestures, starting from acquisition and continuing until text is generated for the corresponding hand ges. 
This project presents a system for static hand gesture recognition for American Sign Language (ASL), specifically aimed at detecting and recognizing the 26 alphabetic letters of ASL. By employing modern machine 
learning algorithms and tools, this system aims to make communication more accessible for individuals with hearing and speech impairments.
